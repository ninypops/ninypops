### Hi there!
### I'm Nina, and I'm a software developer.
###
### I specialise in front-end-technologies, namely Javascript (ES6), React, HTML & CSS.
###
### When I'm not writing code, I'm usually fighting my way through virtual (and real) world pandemics, going to live music events and hanging out at my favourite independent coffee shop.
