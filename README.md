## Hi there!
### I'm Nina, and I'm a Frontend Developer.
This is what I call, a 'playground' for me to experiment and learn. Here, you'll find finished and unfinished projects. Much like my life, it's all a work-in-progress.

### I've recently built:
+ [A simple blog page that delivers content via fetch API](https://github.com/ninypops/simple-blog)
+ [A masonry image gallery with imagekit.io](https://github.com/ninypops/image-gallery)

### I'm currently working on ~~all the things~~ the following:
+ A small, conceptual online store built with create-react-app.
+ I'm always maintaining my [personal website](https://ninypops), configuring it incrementally to be more robust and consolidated.
