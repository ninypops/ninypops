## Hi there!
### I'm Nina, and I'm a Frontend Developer.
This is what I call, a 'playground' for me to experiment and learn. Here, you'll find finished and unfinished projects. Much like my life, it's all a work-in-progress.
### I'm currently working on ~~all the things~~ the following:
+ React project with a AWS Backend to handle authorisation/authentication. [https://github.com/ninypops/react-blog-with-authorization]
+ A Cyberpunk 2077 themed online store with [https://www.contentful.com].
+ I'm always maintaining my personal website, configuring it incrementally to be more robust and consolidated. [https://ninypops.com]
