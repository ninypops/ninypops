### Hi there!
### I'm Nina, and I'm a Frontend Developer.

### My current side project consists of a React project [create-react-app] with a AWS Backend to handle authorisation/authentication. [https://github.com/ninypops/react-blog-with-authorization]
### Also, exploring headless CMS, Contentful.
### I'm always maintaining my personal website, configuring it incrementally to be more robust and consolidated. [https://ninypops.com]
